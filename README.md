# Swift-restful - RESTful API for SWIFT data handling

## 📌 Overview
Swift-restful is a RESTful API for retrieving and modifying SWIFT bank data records stored in a MySQL database, written in Go with Gin framework.

## 🚀 Features
- CRUD operations for accessing and modifying SWIFT data
- Fast look-up by SWIFT code and country ISO2 code
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Utility for fast upload of spreadsheet-stored data

## 🏗️ Setup & Installation
