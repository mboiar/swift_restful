# Swift-restful - RESTful API for SWIFT data handling

## üìå Overview
Swift-restful is a RESTful API for retrieving and modifying SWIFT bank data records stored in a MySQL database, written in Go with Gin framework.

## üöÄ Features
- CRUD operations for accessing and modifying SWIFT data
- Fast look-up by SWIFT code and country ISO2 code
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Utility for fast upload of spreadsheet-stored data

## üèóÔ∏è Setup & Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
