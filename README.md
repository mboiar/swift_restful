# Swift-restful - RESTful API for SWIFT data handling

## üìå Overview
Swift-restful is a RESTful API for retrieving and modifying SWIFT bank data records stored in a MySQL database, written in Go with Gin framework.

## üöÄ Features
- CRUD operations for accessing and modifying SWIFT data
- Fast look-up by SWIFT code and country ISO2 code
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Utility for fast upload of spreadsheet-stored data

## üèóÔ∏è Setup & Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mboiar/swift-restful.git
cd swift-restful
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application with Docker-compose
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```
This will build and start the API along with a MySQL database container. Requests will be accepted at `localhost:8080`.

To populate the database with example data from a spreadsheet, run the CLI parser (See parser [documentation](https://github.com/mboiar/swift_restful/blob/main/cmd/swift-parser/README.md)):
```sh
    docker exec swift_restful-web-1 go run cmd/swift-parser/main.go -f '/go/src/github.com/mboiar/swift-restful/example/Interns_2025_SWIFT_CODES - Sheet1.csv' --skip-duplicates
```
